# Toward A Quantum Neural Network

The following pdf is an unpublished manuscript created in the summer of 2020. With the help of Dr. Bernard Zygelman from the Physics and Astronomy Department at the University of Nevada Las Vegas, we identified the inefficiencies of gradient descent and back-propagation. We also explored possible directions toward replacing gradient descent and back-propagation.
