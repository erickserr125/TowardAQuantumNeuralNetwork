# Toward A Quantum Neural Network

The `Toward A Quantum Neural Network` pdf is an unpublished manuscript (in ACM Citation Style & Format) created in the summer of 2020. With the help of Dr. Bernard Zygelman from the Physics and Astronomy Department at the University of Nevada Las Vegas, we identified the inefficiencies of gradient descent and back-propagation. We also explored possible directions toward replacing gradient descent and back-propagation. The neural network experiments were completed and demonstrated on [our other repository](https://github.com/erickserr125/pneumonia_identification_neural_network).

The `Poster` pdf is a poster presentation which supported my unpublished manuscript. It summarizes key concepts of my project.

Finally, the `PowerpointPresentation_slides` pdf and `SRI-Quantum` video file is a slideshow of my video presentation, which also summarizes key concepts of my project.
